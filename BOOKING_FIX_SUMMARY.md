# ðŸŽ¯ FIXED: Owner Panel Now Shows Real Bookings from SQLite Database

## âœ… Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Owner panel was not showing new bookings created by users because it was using hardcoded data instead of real SQLite database.

**Solution**: Implemented complete SQLite integration for booking system.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. Created Booking API (`/app/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- **POST** - Create new bookings in SQLite database
- **GET** - Fetch user bookings from database
- **PUT** - Cancel bookings (updates database)

### 2. Updated Venue Booking (`/app/venues/[id]/book/page.tsx`)
- Now saves bookings to SQLite database via API
- Maintains localStorage for backward compatibility
- Proper error handling and validation

### 3. Updated Owner Bookings Page (`/app/owner/bookings/page.tsx`)
- Removed hardcoded `mockOwnerStats.recentBookings`
- Now uses `useOwnerBookings` hook with real SQLite data
- Shows upcoming, completed, and cancelled bookings from database
- Added proper filtering by venue/facility

### 4. Updated User Bookings (`/app/my-bookings/page.tsx`)
- Fetches bookings from SQLite database
- Maintains localStorage fallback for compatibility
- API-based booking cancellation

### 5. Added Test Page (`/app/booking-test/page.tsx`)
- Complete API testing interface
- Verify booking creation, retrieval, and cancellation

## ðŸš€ How It Works Now

1. **User Books a Venue**:
   - Booking saved to SQLite database
   - Also saved to localStorage (fallback)

2. **Owner Views Bookings**:
   - Real-time data from SQLite database
   - Filtered by owner's venues
   - Proper categorization (upcoming/completed/cancelled)

3. **User Views "My Bookings"**:
   - Fetches from SQLite database
   - Shows all bookings with current status

## ðŸ§ª Testing

1. Visit `/booking-test` to test API functionality
2. Book a venue as a user via `/venues/1`
3. Check owner panel at `/owner/bookings` - new booking should appear
4. Test cancellation in user's "My Bookings"

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

```sql
bookings table:
- id, user_id, venue_id, court_id
- booking_date, start_time, end_time, duration_hours
- total_amount, status, payment_status
- created_at, updated_at
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

âœ… **Owner panel now shows ALL real bookings from SQLite database**  
âœ… **No more hardcoded data**  
âœ… **Real-time booking updates**  
âœ… **Proper upcoming/completed categorization**  
âœ… **Full booking lifecycle (create â†’ view â†’ cancel)**

The owner can now see all bookings made by users in real-time!
